The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design.

It does taste like the teas I have had at better Asian restaurants. (Some of the cheapo ones don't even serve tea any more.)I like the packaging and the name. Kind of quirky, stripped down and charming to my mind. It is hard for me to find this tea in stores. I called the company and they said it was only available in certain regions.

My only complaint is that the box claims it is 100 natural, but I wish they would disclose the amount and type of Ginseng. I bought this tea because of the Ginseng, so it would be nice if they disclosed what type of Ginseng and what concentration of it is in the tea itself. Since this is a pretty inexpensive tea, I'm guessing it's a cheap low-quality Ginseng, but like I said, it is tasty. Another nice benefit of this tea is that you can just drop the tea bag into a glass of room temperature water and drink it that way, it's very tasty this way!

Patron,Patron174 Silver Tequila - 375ml Bottle,,"This little 3-pack assortment is a great way to try all three flavors of Bali's Best Tea Candy. Previously, I had purchased a single pack of the Citrus Green Tea, from a specialty shop. It was so incredible... I wish I had bought about 10 packs of it.Upon reading reviews, I thought the Classic Iced Tea might be to my liking as well. I am not a big fan of green tea latte, but thought that I should give it a try, since other people raved about it so much. I was right. The Green Tea Latte was my least favorite of the three. It reminded me a little of green tea ice cream. Okay once in a while, but not an every day treat for me. I prefer the crisp/clear taste, over the creamy/milky flavor. Just personal preference.Now, I simply cannot decide which of the other 2 flavors I love more. They are so incredible tasting, and smooth textured. I love both the astringency and the acidity. They are perfectly balanced, and the flavors play like a melody on the palate. If I could, I would order a case of each of them... just so I could have them on hand all the time. They are by far, my favorite candy, bar none. No pun intended. :)*Note to sellers, I refuse to pay 5 or 6 shipping on a single 1.99 bag of candy. This is absolutely ludicrous. Get real!

Brand Castle,"Gosling's Diet Ginger Beer, 12 fl oz",,"I received a case of Goslings diet ginger beer today. I had such high hopes for this product because this would be this first reasonably priced diet ginger beer that I could ship to my home that I have actually heard of (I had previously bought a case of Royalty diet ginger beer at Amazon, but I had never heard of the brand before buying it). I knew Goslings has a good reputation among Ginger Beers, so I had an expectation that I might have found a better diet ginger beer. Sadly, I was mistakenI tried this product in three blind taste tests with Royalty diet ginger beer as my alternative. In each of the three tests, I had a strong preference for Royalty. I found Goslings diet ginger beer to be overly sweet and syrupy, lacking in strong ginger flavor, and completely devoid of that spicy ginger bite that true ginger beer fans expect. Goslings diet ginger beer also has an unpleasant aftertaste that serves as a fitting exclamation point to this products mediocrity.I have had worse ginger beers. Saranac and Reeds come to mind. That said, Goslings diet ginger beer is simply an inferior product. When the price of this soda is similar to the diet ginger beers from Royalty or Barritts (for those who are lucky enough to have access to it), there is simply no reason to purchase Goslings diet ginger beer.Please note: I have used this product as a diet ginger beer, which I consumed plain or over ice.

HomeBrewStuff,IRISH RED ALE Extract Beer Brewing recipe Homebrew kit Malt hops _ grains,,"I reached out in the comments to ask another member how this turned out, but to no avail. Despite my reservations, I ordered the kit and in a few days a USPS box arrived at my house. I opened the box and found that there was no fluff, no boxed kit, there were just ingredients (partial mash) and instructions. The 6 pound pouch of DME and other pouches had handwritten on it what it was and when to use them. Admittedly I wrinkled my nose and thought what the hell is this. Brew day came and went and I had no problems with making the wort, everything went smooth. Eight days go by and I find that the FG reading on the batch is where I want it to be so I bottled 51 bottles of beer to condition.Fast forward 7 days now. I opened one to test it out. This beer turned out really good. The dark red color of the batch hails to it being a true Irish Red. The beer has a slightly malty flavor with subtle hints of caramel notes to it. It's not overly hoppy (which I detest in beers). I'd purchase this again in a heartbeat.As a note to other people who may buy this, I enjoy darker, stouter beers. This might have better results if you thin the wort out by adding an extra 1/2 gallon or so of water. My beer came out darker than what is pictured (see below), some people strive for that true red coloring, and while this turned out red, it is a bit darker than traditional Irish Red's.","Never judge a book by it's cover, because this Irish Red is amazing",reach comment ask anoth member turn avail despit reserv order kit day usp box arriv hous open box found fluff box kit ingredi partial mash instruct pound pouch dme pouch handwritten use admittedli wrinkl nose thought hell brew day came went problem make wort everyth went smooth eight day go find fg read batch want bottl bottl beer conditionfast forward day open one test beer turn realli good dark red color batch hail true irish red beer slightli malti flavor subtl hint caramel note overli hoppi detest beer id purchas heartbeata note peopl may buy enjoy darker stouter beer might better result thin wort ad extra gallon water beer came darker pictur see peopl strive true red color turn red bit darker tradit irish red never judg book cover irish red amaz irish red ale extract beer brew recip homebrew kit malt hop _ grain homebrewstuff

To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgil's is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us.

Fever-Tree,Fever Tree174 Tonic Water - 4pk / 6.8oz Bottle,,"My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagram's. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins.

I happen to prefer vodka tonics to gin and tonics, but the taste of Fever-Tree is so pure that it works with both equally well. My husband prefers G and T's, and he said it has changed the way he views tonic water. What started out as a search for a healthier alternative has actually ended up changing the way we see mixers. I love this tonic water and will be ordering more. With the free shipping, it's actually not much more expensive than Schweppes, especially when you consider that Schweppes goes flat so quickly in the huge liter bottle.

Fever-Tree,Fever Tree174 Tonic Water - 4pk / 6.8oz Bottle,,"My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagram's. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendrick's Gin and it was good, better than Hendrick's in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire.",Best Easily-Available Premium Tonic Water 67 of 75 people found this helpful.

Fever-Tree,Fever Tree174 Tonic Water - 4pk / 6.8oz Bottle,,"These were once the best Ginger Beers in the world. Nothing else even came close. I had been buying these by the case for years from Amazon (sometimes as many as 1-3 cases per month)! They were not only the most mouth watering concoction I had ever tasted in my life (and I know my Ginger Beers), but they helped me so much in quelling the nausea I am dealing with from doing chemo, as there was so much fresh Ginger in them (almost medicinal for me). A tonic that I could never let myself run out of. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I never did run out, and all was well for a very long time.Everything changed in October 2013 when I received three cases of this once wonderful Ginger Beer. They looked funny, tasted odd, and even bitter, and all shared an expiration date of 7/14. I know this product rather well and knew that something was really wrong here. Whatever spilled into the batches that expire 7/14, all had something in them that simply did not belong. There was no mistaking that something was wrong here. We even had neighbors taste test with us, and they agreed that something was definitely very odd in the ones that we had just received, which all expired 7/14.One of these neighbors owns a home nearby, and as a bartender, knows the Fever Tree mixers well.

Powell Mahoney,Powell Mahoney174 Margarita - 750ml Bottle,5.0,"Do you love margaritas They are among the most popular adult beverages in America and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all. The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers They're enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink. Buy a bottle from this Vermont- based company and fall in love with your margarita, all over again.","Fresh, Natural Mixer for the Perfect Margarita",love margarita among popular adult beverag america mani peopl rank favorit alcohol beverag right tequila make notic differ mix margarita right mixer import well one best mixer avail power mahoney margaritai got know powel mahoney recent sing prais ever sinc mix everi bit delici other powel mahoney lineup thank small part natur ingredi use process taken good look ingredi use mixer theyr enough make even toler person cring even realli good tequila often mask tast bad mixer think mani mix drink could bare finish due lessthanpleas mixer basewith powel mahnoey margarita mixer get great natur tast desir good balanc sweet sour pour littl glass tast notic flavor lime littl bit orang overal tast lean toward sour side one seem right match fine tequila tast even good enough peopl might enjoy mixer serv non alcohol combin like soda water even rock noth addedmargarita popular drink even favorit drink lose appeal contain weak ingredi powel mahoney margarita mixer get great natur fresh citru flavor make perfect mix drink buy bottl vermont base compani fall love margarita fresh natur mixer perfect margarita powel mahoney margarita ml bottl powel mahoney

I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now I'm extending that same complaint to mid-2013. Why has Walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for AT LEAST 4 years My recommendation: Spend the extra 24 cents (or whatever) on the real thing: Pillsbury crescent rolls.",Don't waste your calories,actual great valu crescent roll area walmart come white packag black blue write plu pictur coupl beauti crescent roll nonetheless expect experi brand product applic bought dozen variou type flaki butter reduc fat standard problem degre although use roll week prior jun expir date endcap packag dough mani packag dri old poorli store would stick packag imposs unrol dough pri chunk tri put chunk togeth like jigsaw puzzl frankenrol review say thing go back far im extend complaint mid walmart continu deal supplier despit problem least year recommend spend extra cent whatev real thing pillsburi crescent roll dont wast calori great valu origin crescent roll oz great valu

I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix.

I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day.

Kalamera,Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,,"We received the unit a few days ago. So far it is as promised. Noise level outside the unit is acceptable--slightly less than your average refrigerator, around 40db in the surrounding area. Fine for a common area of the home. It cooled our wine down from 77 to 55 degrees pretty quickly. We have tried out a couple of thermo-electric units that seems to run for hours upon hours, never quite reaching the desired temperature--so we decided to go with a compressor based refrigerator that has more power and therefore, won't have to run as many hours (and require service/repair as quickly). The cooler looks great as shown. The refrigerant is R600--it is nontoxic--which is a big plus. When it is running, the top of the unit gets hot--so don't put any candles on it! We removed the second-to-last shelf (towards the bottom) to comfortably accommodate our different-sized bottles. We currently have 30 bottles in there, and could fit comfortably 5-7 more (Syrah, Grenache and Burgundy bottles take up more space than standard Bordeaux-type bottles). It is hard to find a good quality, long-lasting wine refrigerator--after much research--hopefully we have found the best one. Time will tell. Finally, I would give five stars for this cooler, however the seller was extremely slow to respond to my product inquiries and is unclear as to the terms of warranty (other companies have stated one year for cooler plus 3 years for compressor, for instance). Hopefully we won't have any problems in the future, in which case I suppose we would have to lean on Amazon to remedy the situation.",So far so good,receiv unit day ago far promis nois level outsid unit acceptableslightli le averag refriger around db surround area fine common area home cool wine degre pretti quickli tri coupl thermoelectr unit seem run hour upon hour never quit reach desir temperatureso decid go compressor base refriger power therefor wont run mani hour requir servicerepair quickli cooler look great shown refriger rit nontoxicwhich big plu run top unit get hotso dont put candl remov secondtolast shelf toward bottom comfort accommod differents bottl current bottl could fit comfort syrah grenach burgundi bottl take space standard bordeauxtyp bottl hard find good qualiti longlast wine refrigeratoraft much researchhop found best one time tell final would give five star cooler howev seller extrem slow respond product inquiri unclear term warranti compani state one year cooler plu year compressor instanc hope wont problem futur case suppos would lean amazon remedi situat far good kalamera bottl singl zone freestand wine cooler kalamera

COCO REAL,"Coco Real Cream Of Coconut, 21 oz ()",5.0,"I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I don't drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldn't work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldn't even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. It's not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I can't find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy.

Looking at old cocktail books from the 20s, 30s, and 40s I found that bitters were a key ingredient in many classic cocktails. After doing extensive research I learned that Regan's made some of the best, if not the best, orange bitters (go to their website and read the story behind this product). Your other choices are Fee Brothers and Angostura. Regan's however gets, and in my opinion, deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters. These bitters are great in a variety of drinks and I usually put two dashes in my Old Raj martinis. Although you don't get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink. Try these and you won't be disappointed.

Angostura,"Angostura Orange Bitters, 4 fl oz, ()",,"I have been working my way back to classic cocktail recipes ever since reading David Wondrich's book Imbibe! on the great Professor Jerry Thomas and his cocktail recipes and techniques. A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition. As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters. In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door. I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regan's orange bitters (no. 6). Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters. Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle. I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, 11 versus 7 for Fee Brothers and 6 for Regan's. I decided to try it anyway.Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless. Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious. Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle. The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well. In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent. But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini. I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it. I think wit would compliment a splash of pineapple juice in a drink like the Cobalt, but I would not use it in a martini.",Not ready for prime time,work way back classic cocktail recip ever sinc read david wondrich book imbib great professor jerri thoma cocktail recip techniqu wealth inform begin long journey tri recreat cocktail prior great disast call prohibit martini drinker natur want explor tast origin drink began orang bitter market retail carri orang bitter reli ever expens place ship stuff door start fee brother orang bitter tri peychaud version gari regan orang bitter final month ago local liquor wine store chain start stock new angostura orang bitter think would easier le expens support local merchant also want tri bitter pick bottl littl taken aback saw retail price versu fee brother regan decid tri anywayupon open bottl realiz bottl orang color intern content virtual colorless made mani fruit peel extract liqueur suspici forg snif aroma open bottl first smell definit orang underli clove aroma someth cloy behind aroma seem work well drink orang flavor good bitter necessari qualiti bitter appar seem quickli overwhelm someth like passion fruit flavor definit belong martini would consid use product drink fruit juic experi think wit would compliment splash pineappl juic drink like cobalt would use martini readi prime time angostura orang bitter fl oz angostura

Alstertor,"Alstertor Mustard Mug, 8.45 Ounce",,"This mustard came as a Christmas stocking stuffer. I've tried various spicy mustards over the years in hope I would find the perfect mustard. Some have been really good, some not quite so good. And to some extent what I want depends on what sort of mood I'm in and what I'm putting the mustard on. I have come to really like this Alstertor mustard. It has a pleasant taste without being overwhelming. Although I consider it a fairly mild mustard, it is stronger (and nicer) than a typical dijon mustard. At the same time it doesn't have the astringency of certain mustards that heavily emphasize the horseradish. I have found it to be a great complement to large soft pretzels. It also works pretty well with a not overly spiced sausage as well. And I like the little mug.

They're so smooth and soft now - even my boyfriend has commented on them! The consistency is just right, not too thin and not too thick.

I like to apply lip balm before I sleep because my room sits at a cool 11 degrees celsius. I find that because of the consistency, Carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep. Blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when I wake up whilst pawpaw doesn't absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more.

There is always at least 1 in the laundry room (freshly laundered) 2-3 in his desk drawer and a couple of brand new ones, just in case. My only disappointment was the day I went to buy an new jar and the package felt different... My beloved jar was now plastic. My little wonderfully feeling porcelain (I believe) jar was gone, I have to admit, that month I searched for my beloved jar in every store I went, in the hopes that they had not sold out of them, only to be replaced by the new plastic jar.

Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery. I'm giving 2 stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes & the shipping was great as well as QVC customer service. I called & explained everything to QVC and immediately received a refund!! No hassles, questions, etc... just immediately refunded the 2 payments I already made. While the wines disappointed, QVC did not!
